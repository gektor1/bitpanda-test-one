## PHP Technical test

### 1.

Create a new Laravel project using composer

Attached you will find a DB dump. Create a DB connection in laravel using the .env file. 

Seed the DB based on the dump

In the resulted DB you will have these 3 tables: `users`, `countries` and `user_details`.
```
* users: id, email, active
* countries: id, name, iso2, iso3 
* user_details: id, user_id, citizenship_country_id, first_name, last_name, phone_number
```

* 1. Create a call which will return all the users which are `active` (users table) and have an Austrian citizenship.
* 2. Create a call which will allow you to edit user details just if the user details are there already.
* 3. Create a call which will allow you to delete a user just if no user details exist yet.
* 4. Write a feature test for 3. with valid and invalid data

Tips:
- you can use Eloquent to simplify (eg: model binding)
